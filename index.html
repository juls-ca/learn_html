    <h1>HTML Notes</h1>

    <h2>Heading elements:</h2>
    <h1>1st level heading</h1>
    <h2>2nd level heading</h2>
    <h3>3rd level heading</h3>
    <h4>4th level heading</h4>
    <h5>5th level heading</h5>
    <h6>6th level heading</h6>
    <p>This is a paragraph enclosed within opening and closing p tags.</p>    
    
    <!--HTML Entities-->
    <p>
        &amp; gives is the ampersand<br>
        &nbsp; gives a non-breaking space to let browsers know never to do a line break at that space. It can also be used to add additional spaces if needed without the browser ignoring the additional spaces.<br> 
        &lt; gives us the less than sign<br>
        &gt; gives us the greater than sign<br>
        These two can be used to provide brackets and help us display code on the page that will not be executed by HTML.</p>

        &lt;br&gt; tag gives us the line break. It's an empty tag.
        <br>

        &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;code &gt; are used together to display code with indentation on a page. 
        &lt;code&gt; tells the informs the browser that the content is code, while &lt;pre&gt; makes sure indentation in the code is not lost.
        <br>
    </p>

    <!--Marking up text-->
    <p>
        <i>&lt;i&gt; is used for visual-only italics.</i><br>
        <em>&lt;em&gt; is used for emphasis italics.</em><br>
        <b>&lt;b&gt; is used for visual-only bold.</b><br>
        <strong>&lt;strong&gt; is used for content of greater importance.</strong><br>
        Subscripts are characters that are set <sub>below</sub> the normal baseline for text.<br>
        Superscripts are characters that are set <sup>above</sup> the normal baseline of text.<br>
        We can use &lt;small&gt; to convey that a content has very little prominence such as fine print at the bottom of a web page.<br>
    </p>

    <!--3 kinds of lists: Unordered, Ordered, Definition List-->
    <ul>
        <li>unordered list item</li>
        <li>unordered list item</li>
        <li>unordered list item</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>ordered list item</li>
        <li>ordered list item</li>
        <li>ordered list item</li>

    </ol>
    
    <dl>
        <dt>term</dt>
            <dd>definition</dd>
        <dt>term</dt>
            <dd>definition</dd>
        <dt>term</dt>
            <dd>definition</dd>
    </dl>

    <!--Quotes-->
    <p>&lt;q&gt; is used for inline quotes. <br>
    blockquotes are presented as a block-level element.</p>
    <blockquote>
        The most difficult thing is the decision to act. The rest is merely tenacity. The fears are paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do. You can act to change and control your life; and the procedure, the process, is its own reward.
        <cite>- Amelia Earhart</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <!--Date & Time-->
    <p>The time element is used to format. It has container tags. We can use attributes with the time tag, such as datetime which requires a machine-readable "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" format.</p>
    <time datetime="1998-03-10">March 10</time><br>
    <time datetime="1998-03-10">March 10, 1998</time><br>
    <time datetime="1998-03-10">10 March 1998</time><br>

    <!--Attributes-->
    <p>
    Global attributes are attributes that can be used on any element.<br>
    The class attribute allows us to target all elements with that class.<br>
    The id attribute allows us to target a unique elment with that id. Unlike class attributes, it is only used once in an entire HTML page.<br>
    ARIA Roles are HTML attributes that provide accessible information about specific elements.<br>
    </p>

    <!--Linking-->
    <p>
        HTTPS: Hypertext Transport Protocol Secure<br>
        <a href="https://#">This is a  link that uses an Absolute URL</a><br>
        If we are linking within the same domain page, we can use relative URL:<br>
        <a href="/thispage">This is a link that uses a Relative URL</a><br>
        When the browser is directed to a folder, it automatically looks for index.html within that page to load.<br>
    </p>

    <!--Images-->    
    <p>4 attributes are declared with the img element: src, alt, width, height.<br>
    Syntax:<br>
    < img src="#" alt="Alternative text for image" width="#" height="#"><br>
    We can add srcset attribute to provide browsers different image resources along with size information so that browser can pick the most appropriate imaage. Also minimizes bandwith consumption. 
    <br>
    Wrapping img within &lt;figure> and pairing it with &lt;figcaption> gives the browser more semantic information about the content:
    <code><pre>
        &lt;figure>
            < img src="#" alt="test">
            &lt;figcaption>This is a caption for the image.&lt;/figcaption>
        &lt;/figure>
    </pre></code>
    
    <!--Audio-->
    &lt;audio&gt; element is used to place audio in a page (has a closing tag).<br>
    Syntax:
    &lt;audio controls src="audio.mp3" loop autoplay>&lt;/audio><br>
    The controls attribute will include a controls interface if they are available.<br>
    Loop will loop the song when it ends. Autoplay will automatically play the audio as soon as the page loads.<br>

    We can provide more than one audio file using the source element (different from src attribute):
    <code><pre>
    &lt;audio controls>
        &lt;source src="audio.ogg"
            type="audio/off">
        &lt;source src="audio.mp3"
            type="audio/mpeg">
    &lt;audio>
    </code></pre>

    <!--Video-->
    &lt;video> elements adds video files to a page (has a closing tag).<br>
    We can also add the controls attribute to tell the browser to create a video player for us.<br>
    We can also use the source element to provide the browser different file formats.<br>
    Unlike with pictures, there's nothing in HTML that allows us to send different suze of video because we don't want a device to only get one moment to make a choice between different video definitions.<br>
    Devices are constanctly switching from one resolution to another, a technique called <b>adaptive bitrate streaming</b> taht consider's the device resolution and network speed at any moment.<br>
    This is why using embed codes from a video hosting service is more common than using the video element to put a video on a website.<br>
    The track element allow us to point to a text file for captioning.<br>
    Syntax: <br>
    <code>&lt;track src="#" kind="captions" label="english" srclang="en" default><br></code>
    <ul>
        <li>src attribute for file source</li>
        <li>kind attribute tells the browser that the file is for captions. Can also have value substitutions, description, chapters, etc...</li>
        <li>label of english attribute will show up in the player as a label for this choice</li>
        <li>srclang specifies the language</li>
        <li>default attribute specific that this track is th eone we want to use by default when the user turns on caption</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- DIV & SPAN-->
    <h2>&lt;div> and &lt;span></h2>
    div is a block level element and span is an inline element.<br>
    They are used to group elements, create containers, and label html content for styling.<br>
